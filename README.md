# Robot Currito 
This repository documents the progress of Currito 🐦, a multimodal mobile robot controlled through Telegram. This terrestrial device can switch between various modes of operation, such as voice control 🗣️, manual control 🕹️ (via keyboard commands from a computer), or an object tracking mode 👀 using a camera mounted on its head. Additionally, a feature to avoid obstacles ↪️ has been implemented, thanks to the assistance of an ultrasonic sensor located at the front of the robot.


The main code is defined in main.py, while the remaining folders host the code for each separate part.
